"Amnesty PLUS is a group of Amnesty International Korea.
Our mission is to increase awareness on issues of humanitarian injustice from all around the globe by operating an interactive community where eager individuals can freely publish works about their insights and ideas.
We deliver these valuable messages through well-crafted and visually appealing articles, card news, infographics, and videos that are published on the web and shared throughout social media.
