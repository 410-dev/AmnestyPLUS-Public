    <h2><b>Strike Policy</b></h2>
    <p>
        Amnesty PLUS expects all members to follow the rules and important deadlines. If you receive <b>3 strikes</b>, you will be expelled from Amnesty PLUS.<br>
        Strikes will be given out for reasons such as but not limited to:<br>
        1. Failure to meet any sort of deadlines<br>
        2. Failure to follow the HQ member’s instructions<br>
        3. Request from a specific HQ member (Co-founders, Senior Advisors, Department heads,
        Chief Editors) with a sufficient reason<br>
        Demonstration of any sort of inappropriate behavior abusing Amnesty PLUS’s mission, such as
        plagiarism, will immediately lead to the <b>expulsion</b> of the member.<br>
        <b>If you receive two strikes</b>, a warning email with the dates and reasons for your strikes will be
        sent out from the HQ.<br>
        <b>If you receive three strikes</b>, an expulsion email with the dates and reasons for your strikes will be sent out from the HQ.<br>
