    <h2><b>Writing Procedures</b></h2>
    <p>
        ● Articles are split into two categories: News and Opinion.<br>
        ● If a writer wants to write under News, they must not convey any political bias and must provide an objective perspective on the topic at hand.<br>
        ● If a writer wants to write under Opinion, they may exhibit some political bias, but must
        still remain respectful and open-minded of other perspectives.<br>
        ● ALL articles must pertain to the topic of human rights in some way or form.<br>
        ● ALL articles must use appropriate language.<br>
        ● ALL articles must meet photo usage rights.<br>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px"> ○ All photos in the article must be labeled for noncommercial reuse (such as stock
            photos or wikimedia commonsense licensed), or you must have permission from
    the photographer.<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">○ In the article, leave a short label to cite the photo. Examples below.<br></p>
            <p style="text-indent: 40px">○ If you took the photo, there is no need to cite it.<br></p>
        ● Though not necessary, it is highly recommended that every writer adds a “What can
        YOU do to help” section in their articles. This section would include ways in which the
        reader can support the cause that the author wrote about.<br>
